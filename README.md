My master thesis project
=====

This project is a proof-of-concept about a cheap system to help the cataloguing process of food donations for the charity institutions.

It was my first contact with event-driven frameworks, it has some bad designs decisions, the user interface connection is very archaic and the security of the web interface is almost non-existent, but…I really enjoy this project and learned a lot of things. 

It uses Vert.x for Rest communication, web server, location resolver (mobile tower identification) and database communication (MongoDB). For the client side, it uses Android and HTML.

I’m planning to remake it during my free time, but I challenge the community to create a better tool to help the charity institutions.
